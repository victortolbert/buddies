# Can My Cat Eat That?™

## Overview

I've been asked by the CEO of Catopia to build their latest product: **Can My Cat Eat That?™**

My mission is to build a small application that allows users to search and filter through common house plants to see if it’s safe for their pet to take a nibble.

## Features

- ✅  Search for plants by name through use of a search bar
- ✅  Filter non-toxic and toxic plants by using a dropdown
- ✅  Change the view from either a grid or list
- ✅  Clicking on a plant image or name should show the plant’s details

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
