Creative Technologist

Location: Chicago, IL, Seattle, WA, Select U.S. Cities Department: Design & Creative

From our employee experience to our products, design matters at Sprout Social. We’re looking for a Creative Technologist to join our team as we advance our design system, Seeds, to facilitate the development of beautiful, helpful, and easy-to-use software that powers human connection. Seeds is home to all of the tools and resources needed to understand the Sprout brand, express it creatively, and inspire meaningful customer experiences. In this role, you’ll own the creation and stewarding of platform-agnostic products and programs that our internal teams at Sprout can leverage to embody the Sprout brand and build effective experiences more efficiently.

As a Creative Technologist, you’ll be surrounded by smart, ambitious, and caring teammates that want to build great things, together. With our feedback-driven culture, you’ll run workshops to get system, pattern, and component input while offering helpful advice of your own to others. You’ll expand your knowledge of our business, users, and use cases. You’ll put all of your design and front-end development skills on display. Even better: you’ll learn new ones along the way.

Collaboration and partnership is key for everyone working at Sprout Social. On our Design Systems team, you’ll partner with other designers, engineers, product managers, marketers, and senior executives to constantly evolve and improve the integrity of Seeds. You’ll apply past experience advocating for close partnerships across disciplines, leveraging your ability to speak and move fluidly between the languages of these business functions. You’ll bring a much-needed engineering perspective to the design process to voice issues with feasibility and call out missed edge-cases. And, you’ll be a constant user advocate in every conversation you’re a part of, championing the needs of those who engage with your system and demonstrating your keen user-centered problem solving abilities.

We’re excited to see your work at every stage of the design process, from concepts to code. We can’t wait to gain your technical perspective on our approach to work, and hear ideas you may have to improve how we collaborate or even how the business operates. We’ve got a great culture, and we’re looking forward to you adding your own influence to all that we do. If you’re a systems thinker with a proven track record of applying your design and development skills to elevate the quality of products, we’d love to talk to you!
