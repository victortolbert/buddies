Hi Victor! It's been a long time since the AWDG days and I hope you're doing well. I saw your open to work banner and with your front-end focus, I thought you might be interested in the Creative Technologist role we have open here at Sprout Social on our Design Systems Team.

https://sproutsocial.com/careers/open-positions/#/2953236/creative-technologist

I've been remote w/ Sprout for almost 3 months now and it's been much more fun than the enterprise companies I worked at after leaving Atlanta and Mailchimp. I'm a product design manager for the Publishing product zone, so I don't work on Seeds (our design system) myself, but we are all in the same department and collaborate often.

If you're at all interested or just want to learn more about Sprout, let me know and I'd be happy to jump on a Zoom call sometime.
