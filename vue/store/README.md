# When should I use a Store

A store should contain data that can be accessed throughout your application.

This includes data that is used in many places

For example...

- User information that is displayed in the navbar
- as well as data that needs to be preserved through pages
  - e.g. a very complicated multi-step form.

On the other hand, you should avoid including in the store local data that could be hosted in a component instead, e.g. the visibility of an element local to a page.

**Not all applications need access to a global state, but if yours need one, [Pinia](https://pinia.esm.dev/) will make your life easier. Pinia [appears to be][vuex5_preview] the [future for Vuex 5][vuex5]**

- üí° **Intuitive** Stores are as familiar as components. API designed to let you write well organized stores
- üîë **Type Safe** Types are inferred, which means stores provide you with autocompletion even in JavaScript!
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Devtools support** Pinia hooks into Vue devtools to give you a enhanced development experience in both Vue 2 and Vue 3
- üîå **Extensible** React to store changes to extend Pinia with transactions, local storage synchronization, etc
- üèó **Modular by design** Build multiple stores and let your bundler code split them automatically
- üì¶ **Extremely light** Pinia weights around 1kb, you will forget it's even there!
- Add [Nuxt TypeScript](https://typescript.nuxtjs.org/)
- **Code completion** One of the biggest advantages of TypeScript is its code completion and IntelliSense. IntelliSense provides active hints as a code is added
- **Type safety** Types increase your agility when doing refactoring. It‚Äôs better for the compiler to catch errors than to have things fail at runtime
- **Code quality** Types have a proven ability to enhance code quality and understandability. Large teams (Google, Microsoft, Facebook) have continually arrived at this conclusion
