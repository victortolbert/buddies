## What

I've been contracted, and asked by the CEO of Catopia to build their latest product:

My mission is to build a small application that allows users to search and filter through common house plants to see if it’s safe for their pet to take a nibble.

## Features

- ✅ Search for plants by name through use of a search bar
- ✅ Filter non-toxic and toxic plants by using a dropdown
- ✅ Change the view from either a grid or list
- ✅ Clicking on a plant image or name should show the plant’s details
